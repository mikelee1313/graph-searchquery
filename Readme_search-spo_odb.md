**Summary**

This script will use Graph API to Search against SharePoint Online and OneDrive to locate content using search. Since we are using Application based permissions, you donâ€™t need explicit access to the site to retrieve results.

The Azure APP will need the following permisions:

The actual search query is embedded into the **$requestPayload** parameter:

The  "$searchQuery" will look at a file in c:\temp\userlist.txt by default to locate the actual query to issue.

Example of query for a OneDrive site:

"(Contoso Purchasing Data - Q11.xlsx) (path:\"https://m365x49978400-my.sharepoint.com/personal/admin_m365x49978400_onmicrosoft_com\")"

**!Important!**

The searchRegion must match your Tenant regions.

_Performing a search with application permission is limited to one geographic region. You must specify a value for the region property in your search request when you use application permissions to run a search. To get the region value for a tenant, use the dataLocationCode property of the siteCollection resource._


After running the script, the output will create a CSV file in the user local temp folder %temp%.
