## Overview

These scripts use the Microsoft Graph API to:
- Search for SharePoint Copilot Agents across your entire Microsoft 365 tenant.
- Generate detailed CSV and log reports about Copilot Agents, including security and site metadata.
- Perform bulk searches on SharePoint/OneDrive items using custom queries.
- Download files found via search queries, if desired.

All scripts support secure authentication and pagination of large result sets.

---

## Prerequisites

- **PowerShell 7.x** recommended.
- **PnP.PowerShell module** (for insights script):  
  Install with `Install-Module -Name PnP.PowerShell -Scope CurrentUser`
- A **registered Azure AD/Entra application** with permissions:
  - `Sites.Read.All`
  - `Sites.FullControl.All` (for insights)
  - `Files.Read.All` (for OneDrive/SharePoint search)
  - `SearchQuery.All`
- **Certificate-based authentication** recommended for the Insights script.
- Appropriate admin rights for the SharePoint tenant and the Entra app registration.

---

## Authentication

All scripts use OAuth 2.0 authentication via Azure AD application credentials.  
You must set these variables at the top of each script:

```powershell
$tenantId = '<your-tenant-id>'
$clientId = '<your-client-id>'
$clientSecret = '<your-client-secret>' # Not needed if using certificate auth
```

For the _Insights_ script, certificate-based authentication is used.  
Set these variables at the top:

```powershell
$tenantname = "<your-tenant-name>"  # Without .onmicrosoft.com
$appID = "<your-app-id>"
$thumbprint = "<your-cert-thumbprint>"
$tenantid = "<your-tenant-id>"
```

- `appID`: Entra (Azure AD) App ID
- `thumbprint`: Certificate thumbprint for authentication
- `tenantid`: Tenant GUID
- `searchRegion`: `"NAM"`, `"EMEA"`, etc.

**Features:**
- Uses Microsoft Graph for agent search
- Uses PnP.PowerShell for detailed site reporting

- `searchQueryList`: Path to a plain text file with one query per line (e.g., `C:\temp\userlist.txt`)
- `LogName`: Path to the output CSV (default: auto-generated in `%TEMP%`)

**Output:**
- CSV file in `%TEMP%` named `Search_Results_<timestamp>.csv`

**Usage Example:**
```powershell
# Prepare a plain text file with search queries, one per line
$searchQueryList = Get-Content 'C:\temp\userlist.txt'
# Run the script
./search-spo_odb.ps1
```
