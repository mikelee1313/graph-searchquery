**Summary**

This script will use Graph API to Search against SharePoint Online and OneDrive to locate content using search. Since we are using Application based permissions, you donâ€™t need explicit access to the site to retrieve results.

The Azure APP will need the following permisions:

"(Contoso Purchasing Data - Q11.xlsx) (path:\"https://m365x49978400-my.sharepoint.com/personal/admin_m365x49978400_onmicrosoft_com\")"
